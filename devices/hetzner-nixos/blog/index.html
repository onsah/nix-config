            <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I am Onur Sahin, I use Aiono nickname in online platforms. I am a software developer and currently Computer Science MSc. student in <a href="https://uni-freiburg.de/en/">Freiburg University</a>.</p>
<p>I got my bachelors in Computer Science from <a href="https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/">Bilkent University</a> in 2021. After graduation, I worked full time at <a href="https://carbonhealth.com/">Carbon Health</a> until late 2023. In 2023 I started doing masters in Computer Science at <a href="https://uni-freiburg.de/en/">Freiburg University</a>. I love software engineering but I always wanted to try getting into programming languages &amp; formal verification area so currently I am doing masters to see if I would like it.</p>
<p>I like to play guitar a lot and I want to write my music in the future. I am also a huge music fan (Favorite groups are Opeth and Porcupine Tree but I listen to a lot of different types of music). And I have a vinyl collection that is ever growing. I like to play board games. I am not very sportive person but I try to get into bouldering.</p>
